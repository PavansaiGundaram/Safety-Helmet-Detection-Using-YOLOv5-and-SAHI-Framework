# Safety Helmet Detection Using YOLOv5 and SAHI Framework

## Overview

This project demonstrates the use of the YOLOv5 model and the SAHI (Slicing Aware Hyper Inference) framework for detecting safety helmets in images and videos. The goal is to build a real-time helmet detection system that can be applied in industrial settings to ensure safety compliance.

## Key Technologies

- **YOLOv5**: A state-of-the-art object detection model that provides accurate and fast predictions in real-time.
- **SAHI (Slicing Aware Hyper Inference)**: A framework used to improve the accuracy of object detection by slicing large images into smaller chunks, ensuring better detection performance.

## How It Works

1. **YOLOv5 Model**: This is used to detect safety helmets within the images or video frames. The model is fine-tuned on a relevant dataset to recognize helmets.
2. **SAHI Framework**: This framework is used to slice large images into smaller, more manageable parts for inference, improving the overall accuracy of helmet detection.

## Applications

This system can be deployed in real-time video feeds to monitor safety helmet usage in industries such as construction or manufacturing, ensuring compliance with safety regulations.
